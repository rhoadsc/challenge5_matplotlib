# challenge5_matplotlib

Used the following git hub repositories for checking errors, debugging, and figuring out the isin filtering function: redeat17 and jamiedataviz.

Used pandas-dev to look up information about the pandas.groupby function.

Worked in tandem with two classmates: Kelly Carter, Rebecca Willis, and offered assistance to other classmates in the Slack channel around the isin function.
